# Xgboost-Model
Xgboost model with 4 datasets that explains the variables that more impact in the clients of a credit card plan after 2 years 
This projet was did to understand the behaviour of the consumers of credit cards after 2 years according to diffferent variables, such as: credit_score, age, balance, plans, etc. 
I decided to used a Xgboost model because it fited better with the data after different tests with GLM, LDA, QDA, etc.
